## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AkilSelot/Sales-Predictor.git
Navigate into the project folder:

cd Sales-Predictor
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
🐍 Run Python Scripts
Run Data Cleaning – cleans raw sales data and saves it to data/processed/

Run Sales Prediction – trains a model and outputs predicted sales

Clicking these links on GitHub opens the script so users can view the code directly.

📊 View Data Table
Click here to view the cleaned sales data

This opens the CSV as a table directly in GitHub.

📈 Example Output
Cleaned data saved in data/processed/

Predicted sales plotted using Matplotlib

Model evaluation metrics displayed in the console (e.g., MAE)

💡 Notes
You can replace the CSV dataset with your own sales data for testing

The scripts are modular — you can easily improve the model or add new features
